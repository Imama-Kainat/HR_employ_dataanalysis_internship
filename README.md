# HR_employ_dataanalysis_internship
HR data analyzed for attrition. Factors like education, role, travel, department, tenure, age, gender, rating, balance impact attrition. Insights guide HR to reduce attrition.

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - The first line of the code imports the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for data visualization.

2. **Reading the Dataset:**
   - The second line of the code reads the HR employee dataset from a CSV file named 'HR-Employee-Attrition.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame called 'df'.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - The 'df' DataFrame is then cleaned to remove redundant columns, rename columns, drop duplicate rows, clean individual columns, and remove NaN values.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - The code then visualizes the data using various plots like a correlation map, bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and box plots. These visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different variables and their impact on employee attrition.

5. **Interpreting Insights:**
   - Finally, the insights gathered from the visualizations are interpreted. For example, the correlation map helps identify correlations between variables, and the other visualizations help identify patterns and trends in employee attrition based on various factors like education, job role, business travel, department, tenure, age, gender, performance rating, and work-life balance.

Overall, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition and related factors, which can help HR departments make informed decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.
